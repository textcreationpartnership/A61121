            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True and Faithful Relation OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THEIR <hi>Majeſties Forces,</hi> IN THE CARRIBBY ISLANDS.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of this ſmall Treatiſe, is to give a Succinct Relation, of the Proceedings of their Majeſties Forces, in the <hi>Caribby-Iſlands;</hi> and in a plain and Compendious Method, a faithful Narrative of the moſt remarkable Tranſactions, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War, to this preſent time: Only I muſt deſire to be excuſed, in the Omiſſion of noting the particular Days of the Month in ſome places, The loſs of ſome Papers, having forced me to be leſs exact in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that, than I could wiſh; but as that is not abſolutely material and <hi>per ſe,</hi> but only circumſtantial and <hi>per Accidens,</hi> I preſume it may the more eaſily be pardoned.</p>
            <p>But before I fall upon the intended Matter, I think it not amiſs, to ſhew the firſt grounds and Reaſons of the Differences, which have happened in thoſe parts. Be pleaſed then to know, that the Iſland of St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> hath formerly been a Stage of War between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French:</hi> But of late Years Matters being accommodated, and the Iſland divided between them, they have each of them lived under their own Government, and an Act of Neutrality hath paſſed by the Conſent of both their Kings, to the Intent they might there enjoy a quiet and an Uninterrupted Peace, notwithſtanding any Wars that might happen between the two Crowns in <hi>Europe:</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> being a fickle and inconſtant People, broke through all thoſe Conſiderations, and before the Wars were Proclaimed between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> prompted by ſome private Animoſities of their own, and animated by the Inſtigations and Impulſions of ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> upon the Iſland; in the Month of <hi>July</hi> 1689, entred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground with Fire and Sword, forcing the Inhabitants to fly to the Fort for their ſafety.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being in this Diſtreſs, applied themſelves to the Government of
<hi>Barbados</hi> for Aſſiſtance; upon which application the Honourable Sir <hi>Timothy Thornhil</hi> Baronet, offered himſelf, to go at the Head of a Regiment to their Relief; to which the Governour Council and aſſembly aſſenting, the Drums
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105601:4"/>beat up for Voluntiers, and in leſs than a Fortnight, there was raiſed a Regiment of ſeven Hundred able Men, all which (the Commiſſioned Officers excepted) were fitted with Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the ſaid Expedition, at the Coſt and Charges of the Iſland of <hi>Barbados,</hi> convenient Veſſels being alſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the tranſporting them to the Iſland of St. <hi>Chriſtophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things being in a Readineſs, they Imbarqued and ſet Sail on Thurſday the firſt of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> and on Monday following, being the Fifth of the ſaid Month, they arrived at the Iſland of <hi>Antigua,</hi> where they received the unwelcome News, that the Fort at St.
<hi>Chriſtophers</hi> was ſurrendred to the <hi>French,</hi> on Monday the 29th of
<hi>July</hi> upon Articles, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent off to the adjacent Iſland of
<hi>Nevis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Affairs being thus Stated, Sir <hi>Timothy Thornhil</hi> knowing his Strength to be inconſiderable to attack an Iſland ſo well mann'd and fortified as St.
<hi>Chriſtophers;</hi> And the Government of <hi>Antigua</hi> alſo ſolliciting him to continue with them till the Arrival of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, which was daily expected; he agreed to their Propoſals, and landed his Regiment there, quartering them in the Town of
<hi>Falmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a Months Continuance in the ſaid Iſland, Lieutenant General <hi>Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> ſent three Sloops, Man'd with fourſcore of Sir <hi>Timonthy's</hi> Regiment under the Command of Captain <hi>Edward Thorne,</hi> to fetch their Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with their Goods and Stock, from the Iſland of <hi>Anguilla,</hi> where they were miſerably abuſed and deſtroyed, by ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> had put on Shore amongſt them: Before, and during Sir <hi>Timothy's</hi> Stay in <hi>Antigua,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Neighbouring Iſlands, who were in League with the <hi>French,</hi> land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral times upon the ſaid Iſland, killing thoſe Inhabitants that lived near to the Sea, (to the Number of Ten) and then making their Eſcape in their ſwift Periaquas, notwithſtanding the beſt Sailing Sloops were ſent in purſuit of them; but by the Diligence of the Lieutenant General, in placing Guards at all the Bays and landing Places, thoſe Incurſions were afterwards prevented.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>September,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Privateer landing at Five Iſlands near <hi>Antigua,</hi> had taken off ſome <hi>Negroes;</hi> and in his going away met with two
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Sloops, one of which after ſome Reſiſtance he took; the other making her Eſcape, came in and gave an Account of the Action; upon which Sir <hi>Timothy</hi> ſent out two Sloops, Man'd with a Company of <hi>Granadiers,</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi>Walter Hamilton,</hi> who next day brought her in with her Prize: On board the Privateer, (beſides thirty <hi>French</hi>) were ſix <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who were tried by a Court Marſhal, and four of them deſervedly executed.</p>
            <p>At this time a dreadful Mortality raging in the Iſland of <hi>Nevis,</hi> eſpecially among the Men which had reduced that Sex to a Moiety of its uſual num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; forced the Inhabitants to make their Addreſſes to Sir <hi>Timothy,</hi> (who now had received a Commiſſion for Major General,) to bring his Regiment down thither for their Defence, their Iſland lying within two Leagues of St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> and in daily expectation of being attacked; the Major General weighing their Neceſſity, after the violence of the Diſtemper was abated, in the Month of <hi>November</hi> removed his Regiment thither, encamping them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a commodious Plain, cloſe adjoyning to a River.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> the Lieutenant General coming down to <hi>Nevis,</hi> called a General Council of War, in which it was determined, that the Major General with three hundred of his own Regiment, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Neviſians</hi> ſhould go down and attack St.
<hi>Martins</hi> and St. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> two Iſlands belonging to the Enemy, in which they reared conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Stock for the ſupport and maintenance of other their Sugar Iſlands; in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105601:4"/>order to which Expedition, the Major General on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 15th of the ſaid Month, put his Forces on board the Veſſels provided for them, (being one Brigantine, and nine Sloops,) and on <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th he himſelf imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, and the Fleet ſet Sail for the ſaid Iſlands. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 18th in the Morning, we paſt by St.
<hi>Bartholomews,</hi> and about four in the Afternoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within four or five Leagues of St.
<hi>Martins,</hi> we eſpied a ſmall Sloop ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up towards us, but upon ſight of us ſhe tacked, and put into one of the Bays: When we came up with the Bay where ſhe lay, the Major General ſent one Lieutenant <hi>Dowden</hi> with three Files of Men in a Boat, to go up to her and board her, and if ſhe were floating to bring her out; when the Boat was got near on Board, the Enemy who lay hid in the Buſhes on each ſide, (the Bay being Land-lock'd) fired very thick upon them, forcing them to retreat, two of them being wounded. The Major General being very deſirous to have the Sloop, after it was dark, ſent thirty Men in four Boats and Canoes, under the Command of Captain <hi>Walter Hamilton,</hi> again to attempt the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her out; but the Enemy diſcovered them, and fired hotly upon them; the Canoe which Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> was in, rowed cloſe up to the Sloop, and found her run on Ground, the Men being all gone out of her, ſo were forced to leave her, and return to their Veſſels: Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> received two Shots in one of his Legs, about four Perſons more being wounded, but none killed; that Night we ſtood off and on, as though we deſigned to land in the Morning.</p>
            <p>The next Day being the 19th, there was a Council of War held by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers on board the Brigantine, wherein it was determined, firſt to attack St. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> and accordingly the Sloops ſtood up in the Night to the ſaid Iſland: The next Morning before Day, Major
<hi>John Stanley</hi> landed with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Men, notwithſtanding the Oppoſition of the Enemy, and beat them out of their Breaſt-Works, and by break of Day he had planted his Colours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Battery they had, conſiſting of two great Guns: All the Forces being landed, the Major General ordered them to take three ſeveral Ways; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf leading his own Guard of Gentlemen Reformadoes, with two Companies more through the Body of the Iſland. After a Miles March, we diſcovered a large Fortification, which appeared to be well Mann'd; but the Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral running down bravely with his Men, ſo diſheartned the Enemy, that after they had given us two or three Volleys, they quitted it, and fled into the Woods. The Fortification was quadrangular, conſiſting of about two Acres of Land, encompaſſed with double Rows of Stakes, ſix Foot high, and four Foot diſtant; the Intervals being fill'd with Earth, and a wide deep Trench without it; on each Corner there was a Flanker, in one of which was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four great Guns; the Entrance into it was a Lock, admitting but one at a time; in the middle of it was the Governours Houſe, and a Guard-Houſe for the Souldiers; alſo a large Ciſtern with ſtore of Water; ſeven or eight Barrels of dried Salt Fiſh, with Bread proportionable, and two Barrels of Powder: It was ſituate in a Bottom by the ſide of a Lane, through which we were to paſs to come at it, and on the other ſide was a very high Hill. After we had entred it, the Major General ſent this Relator with four Files of Men to gain the top of the Hill, which he did, finding it fortified with two great Guns loaden and primed, with the Match lighted, and ſeveral Bags of Partridge-Shot lying by them, but the Enemy was in ſo much haſt, they did not ſtay to fire them upon us.</p>
            <p>About four Miles diſtant from the Fortification, upon the ſide of a Hill, there appeared a large white Building, reſembling a Fort, to which the Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſent three hundred Men under the Command of Colonel <hi>Charles Pym,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105601:5"/>with Orders, if he found it ſtrong, to ſit down before it, and wait his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. About two of the Clock the Major General (leaving a ſufficient Guard in the Fortification) marched up thither with the reſt of his Forces, and when we came to it, we found it to be only a Stone Plat-form, laid ſhelving for the conveyance of the Rain Water into the Ciſtern; the Iſland being deſtitute of Rivers, Wells, or other Conveniencies of freſh Water, the Inhabitants are forced to make uſe of all Advantages to catch the Rain, each Houſe being furniſhed with one or more of theſe Ciſterns, ſome of them capable of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twelve or fourteen Tuns. There we encamped that Night, and the next Day (the 21ſt) we marched back to the Fortification.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> (the 22d) in the Morning, two Captains of the Enemy came in with a Flag of Truce, bringing Articles from their Governour, upon which they offered to ſurrender themſelves; which, when the Major General had peruſed, he returned an Anſwer to him in writing, and alſo by two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who ſpoken <hi>French,</hi> which he ſent to him, that his Terms were denied; but if he would come in with the Inhabitants, with their Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, within three Days, he ſhould find him a Gentleman; but if he ſtood out longer, he was to expect no Quarter: That Night the Gentlemen return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Camp with an Anſwer from the Governour, That on
<hi>Wedneſday</hi> he would come in, but he could not ſooner, becauſe ſome of the Inhabitants were hid in the Woods, to whom he could not communicate his Deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Tueſday</hi> (the 23d and 24th) we marched round the Iſland, burning all the Houſes as we paſſed along; the Inhabitants in ſome places firing upon us from the Woods, but without any Damage.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> (the 25th) we eſpied a Flag of Truce coming toward us, with the Governour, and a great Company of the Inhabitants; upon which, the Major General having his own Company of Guards in the Fortification, and the reſt of his Forces drawn up round it, ſent the two Gentlemen who were before with him, to meet the ſaid Governour, and at the Entrance into the Fortification, he was received by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>John Thomas,</hi> and by him conducted to the Major General, who ſat in the Houſe; (which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſembled a Pigeon Houſe, than a Governours Pavilion, as the <hi>French</hi> termed it; for it conſiſted only of one Room about twelve Foot ſquare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and another above:) he was accompanied by a Frier, and ſome of his Officers, all which were received with great Civility by the Major General, and many Complements paſſed between them: After ſome Diſcourſe they went to Dinner, and the Major General ſo well warmed the Frier with good <hi>Madera</hi> Wine, that he ſpoke Latin ſo fluently upon
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that he confounded himſelf in his own Argument. The Priſoners who came, in were between ſix and ſeven hundred, all which were tranſported, the Governour with the Men as Priſoners to <hi>Nevis,</hi> the Women and Children to St.
<hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;</hi> all the live Stock was alſo carried up to <hi>Nevis,</hi> with the Negroes, Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Major General returned the Governour ſome of his Negroes, his Horſe, Arms, Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be carried for him to St. <hi>Chriſtophers.</hi> In taking this Iſland we had about ten Men kill'd and wounded.</p>
            <p>While we were thus buſied in ſacking this Place, Colonel <hi>Hewetſon</hi> landed with three hundred <hi>Antigua</hi> Men upon another Iſland belonging to the <hi>French,</hi> called
<hi>Marigalanta,</hi> beating the Inhabitants into the Woods, burning their Town, nailing their Guns, demoliſhing their Fort, and returned to <hi>Antigua</hi> with the Plunder of their Iſland.</p>
            <p>During our ſtay upon St. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> we had an addition of eight or nine
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105601:5"/>Sloops, with about fifty Men, from ſome of the Neighbouring, Iſlands, which the Major General made Advantage of; for on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 19th of <hi>January,</hi> he ſent the Brigantine with nine Sloops, (the like number that had been there before) under the Command of Captain <hi>Walter Hamilton,</hi> to alarm the Iſland of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> and the next Morning to make a falſe Attack on the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Side: After Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> was gone down, the ſame Day the Major General embarqued with all his Forces in the other Sloops, and in the Night ſet Sail for the ſaid Iſland, and the next Morning (the 20th) landed all his Men on the Leeward Side without any Oppoſition, the Enemy having drawn all their Forces to the other ſide of the Iſland; only after the firſt Company was landed, about twenty of the Enemy fired upon them from a Breaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they were ſoon beat out of it. When all the Forces were landed, they marched entire through the Body of the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after two Miles march, were drawn up in convenient Plain, the Enemy being in ſight, and as we thought advancing towards us: After we had continued an hour in this Poſture, the Enemy retiring, had fired a great Building upon a Hill, about a Mile diſtant, which ſeem'd to be a Fortification; upon which, the Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral marched up to it with the whole Body, but found it to be only a large Houſe, which they had burnt becauſe it ſhould not ſerve us for Shelter, but the Stone Walls, which remained ſtanding, however proved ſerviceable to us, in covering us from their Shot. There was a large Ciſtern of Water, but they had rendred it unfit for drinking, by throwing Salt into it; a Pond alſo that was adjacent, they had poiſoned with Tobacco. We had not been long here before the Enemy began to fire upon us from a Breaſt-work, where they had two great Guns planted upon a Hill a quarter of a Mile diſtant, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clear Valley between us; on the left hand low and buſhy Ground, and on the right, a ridge of Mountains with a very thick Wood: The Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſent Captain <hi>Burt</hi> with a Company of Men to gain the top of the higheſt Mountain, which had the Command of the Poſt we were at; which being done, he left an hundred Men under the Command of Captain <hi>Geoffery Gibb;</hi> to maintain that Poſt, and marched back into the Plain with the reſt of his Forces to ſecure the Avenues, and hinder the Enemy from coming upon our Backs: Being come down into the Plain, himſelf, with ſeveral Officers, and about an Hundred Sentinels, went to drink at a Well, where, while they were drinking, they received a Volly of about thirty Shot from the Enemy, who lay hid in the Woods, but it pleaſed God though they ſtood cloſe one by another, there was but one Man hurt.</p>
            <p>Withdrawing from thence, Major <hi>John Stanly</hi> was ſent with a Party to rout them out of the Woods, which he did, beating them from ſtrong Breaſt-works they had upon a Saddle between two Hills, (oppoſite to thoſe we had before gained) in which Works he poſted himſelf. The Paſſages being both ways ſecured, the Major General encamped with the Body in the middle of the Plain that Night, and the next Morning (the 21ſt) our two Braſs Field-Pieces, with Carriages, and two Iron ones, without, were brought on Shore; the Iron ones were planted in the Plain, but the Braſs were drawn up to the burnt Houſe, where our Body was now encamped, and about three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we began to play upon the Enemy. In the Evening Captain
<hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Sharp</hi> was ſent with one Company of Men to cut a Path through the Wood, that we might make an Attack upon the Enemy that way; for in the Valley they had four great Guns planted directly againſt the Road; but being without Carriages, they could not bring them to bear upon us as we lay: Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> had made no great Progreſs in his Work before he was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105601:6"/>and ſo hotly dealt with, that he was forced to retreat: All Day the Enemy kept firing upon us from their Breaſt-work, both with their great Guns and ſmall Arms, but in the Night they ſilently quitted it.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, (the 22d) leaving thirty Men at the burnt Houſe (under the Command of Lieutenant <hi>James Smith</hi>) we marched over to the Breaſt-work and demoliſhed it, and alſo their Line, which run down to a Well in the Valley near their four great Guns, which we nailed, together with the other two above. Continuing our March about a Mile farther, we came to a fine Plain, encompaſſed with Orange and other Fruit-Trees, where we encamped, there being ſtore of Cattle alſo graſing; at the upper end of it were three ſmall Houſes, in one of which were found Blood, and Dreſſings of ſome wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, and we underſtood by two Priſoners which we took preſently after, that they had near twenty kill'd and wounded: The next Morning (the 23d) the Major General leaving this Relator with a ſufficient Guard in the Plain, to take care of the Plunder; he marched with the Body againſt their chief Fort, about two Miles diſtant, which he took without any loſs having but one Man wounded, the Enemy quitting their Fort after a ſmall reſiſtance: It conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſix great Guns mounted upon a Plat-form without Carriages, with Banks of Earth thrown up; after he had nailed and overthrown the Guns, he proceeded in his march about four Miles farther, and then encamped in a pleaſant Valley, where was a Houſe and Garden belonging to the Frier: there they found the Governour's Horſe ſaddled and bridled, he having left him and fled into the Mountains with the Inhabitants: This Day Major
<hi>John Stanly</hi> marched over the Hills on the other ſide the Iſland, and engaged a Party of the Enemy, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of their Breaſt-work, and demoliſhing it; at Night he returned to his Poſt on the Saddle: (the 24th) the Major General continued his march round the Iſland without any oppoſition, and at Night returned to the burnt Houſe, where he again encamped; the Plunder being alſo removed thither.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, (the 25th) we ſaw three great Ships, a Brigantine and a Sloop ſtanding in with the Iſland, and about Noon we underſtood by ſome Priſoners, which we took landing out of the ſaid Sloop, that it was Mounſieur <hi>Decaſs</hi> come down from St.
<hi>Chriſtophers</hi> with ſeven hundred Men, to defend the Iſland againſt us, who they heard had been upon St. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> and they thought us to be yet there: The Major General immediately commanded away Guards to all thoſe Bays where he thought the Enemy would land; but they ſeeing our Sloops, perceived we were already upon the Iſland, and ſo came not to an Anchor, but gave Chaſe to our Sloops, who made the beſt of their Way to get clear; one of them in great danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, run her ſelf on ground, but was again hal'd off by the Enemy, but the Men were all got out of her: The Maſter of one of the Sloops being at the Camp, when the Priſoners were brought up who gave this Account, the Major General diſpatched him with an Expreſs to <hi>Antigua,</hi> to acquaint the Lieutenant General with our Condition, and deſire him to ſend ſome Ships to our Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decaſs</hi> ſtood off and on all night, and in the morning (the 26th) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe in with the Shore, he fired ſeveral Guns, to give the Inhabitants notice of his Arrival: About noon he came to an Anchor before the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Iſland, hanging abroad bloody Colours. The Inhabitants, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the coming of theſe Ships, came down out of the Mountains, and finding their Fort unman'd, they again took poſſeſſion of it, replanting and drilling their Guns. In the night <hi>Decaſs</hi> landed his Souldiers; which the Major General having advice of, brought his Braſs Field-Pieces from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105601:6"/>Burnt-Houſe into the plain, and planted them on the right and left Wing of the Body, which was there encamped; the Iron Pieces being planted before towards each Road, having placed ſtrong Guards upon the Saddle, at the Burnt-Houſe and the Mountain which commanded it: In this Poſture of Defence, we continued the 27th 28th &amp; 29, the Enemy not daring to attack us: They had now three Ships more come down from St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> which joyned with
<hi>Decaſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Thurſday (the 30th) in the Morning, arrived Collonel <hi>Hewetſon</hi> from
<hi>Antigua</hi> with three Ships, which the Lieutenant General had ſent to our Aſſiſtance: The French Ships at an Anchor perceiving Engliſh Colours, weighed, and ſtood out to meet them; About Noon they engaged, and after four hours Diſpute, with little damage on our Side, the
<hi>French</hi> bore away, our Ships alſo ſtanding off all night, but in the morning (the
31ſt) they returned: The <hi>French</hi> Ships alſo appeared in ſight, but kept off at a diſtance: The Major General having ſent the Plunder and Field-Pieces on Board, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all his Out-Guards to quit their Poſts, and march down into the Plain in Order to Imbarque; which the Enemy perceiving, marched down likewiſe, and both Parties engaged, to the great loſs of the Enemy, who was beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Woods in Confuſion: The Major General made an Honourable retreat, and Imbarqued ſafe with all his Men, except about ten who were kill'd in the whole Action, and three who were taken Priſoners, by being aſleep in one of the Breaſtworks, when our Men quitted them: One of them made his Eſcape and got down to the Sea Side, and a Boat went and brought him off clear; the other two were afterwards exchanged: There were about twenty more wounded, which with the reſt arrived ſafe at <hi>Nevis,</hi> on Sunday Morning the ſecond of
<hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Major General's Regiment returned up to <hi>Nevis,</hi> the Inhabitants of the ſaid Iſland conſidering the ſervice they had done, and their Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to continue in their defence, againſt the expected Aſſaults of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Enemy; in the Month of
<hi>April</hi> 1690. they allowed the ſaid Regiment Pay, ſo to continue for ſix Months, except the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet ſhould arrive, and then to be allowed Pay but one Month after the Arrival of the ſaid Fleet; Which hapned in <hi>June</hi> following, at which time, Preparations being made for an Expedition againſt St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> by all the Leeward
<hi>Caribby Iſlands,</hi> they brought their Forces down to the Iſland of <hi>Nevis,</hi> which was appointed to be the place of General Rendevouz, it lying moſt Convenient for the ſaid purpoſe; And upon Monday the 16th. of <hi>June</hi> 1690, by the Command of his Excellency

               </hi> we Imbarqued for the ſaid Expedition; and upon Thurſday the 19th we ſet Sail from <hi>Nevis</hi> with our whole Fleet, conſiſting of ten Men of War, two Fireſhips, twelve Merchant Men, and about twenty Brigantines and Sloops; and the ſame Evening, we came to an Anchor before the Iſland of St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers</hi> in Frigot Bay: In the night eight of our Frigots weighed, and fell down three Leagues to Leeward, to amuſe and harras the Enemy, and the next morning they returned: That day we plyed our great Guns from ſome of the Frigots, which lay neereſt in with the Shore, upon the Enemy in their Trenches, and received ſome Shot in Exchange, from a Battery of five Guns they had there, but without any damage on our Side.</p>
            <p>That night there was a Council of War held on board the Admiral, by the General Officers and ſome of the prime Commanders, according to the Reſult of which, Major General <hi>Thornhil</hi> with four hundred of his own Regiment and a Detatchment of one hundred and fifty out of the Regiments of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerat, Nevis</hi> and <hi>Antigua,</hi> between two and three of the Clock the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being Saturday the 21ſt, landed with the Forelorn (the Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark being Matches about their left Arms (at the little Saltponds, about a League to Windward of the aforeſaid Frigot Bay, without any Oppoſition; the Enemy having left that place ungarded by reaſon of it's Situation, it lying at the foot of an almoſt inacceſſible Hill, over which they thought it an Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to march: This Steep Aſcent we mounted by a Path frequented by none but wild Goats, and in ſome places ſo near a perpendicular, that we were forced to uſe our Hands as well as our Feet in climbing up. About break of Day we gained the top, where we received a Volly of about ſeven or eight Shot, from ſome Scouts there placed, (who immediately upon their firing retreated) which wounded us two brisk Commanders, one of which died of his Wounds ſoon after. The Major General leaving one Company to ſecure the Paſs upon the Hill, led his Men down about a third part of it, before they were diſcovered by the Enemy, who now began to fire briskly upon us from their Trenches, wounding ſeveral of our Men, and the Major General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf received an unfortunate Shot through the ſmall of his left leg, which obliged him to ſtay the binding of it up; but his Men running down briskly upon the Enemy, and Flanking them in their Trenches, and the Duke of <hi>Bolton's</hi> and the Marine Regiments landing at the ſame time at Frigot Bay, (in which Action Colonel <hi>Kegwin</hi> received a mortal wound) forced them to quit their Poſt in diſorder and leave us maſters of the Field: We found fourteen of them dead, we having loſt half the number, beſides wounded Men.</p>
            <p>All our Forces being landed, and the Major General with the wounded Men ſent on board, the Army was drawn up into four Battalions: The Duke of <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi> Regiment in the Van, was Ordered to take the Road adjoyning to the Sea; The Major General's Regiment (under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>John Thomas</hi>) in the Body, was ordered to march through the Countrey, and the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua</hi> Regiment was commanded to march at a diſtance, as a Reſerve to the Body: The other four Regiments were to keep their Poſts, &amp; wait farther Orders. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an hours march the Duke of <hi>Bolton</hi>'s Regiment encountred a ſmall party of the

            <p>Orders being ſent to the four Regiments at Frigot Bay to march up, and the Duke of

            <p>While the Army was thus refreſhing, the Cockſwain of the <hi>Mary</hi> Frigot came with Advice to the Captain General that the Frigots having fallen down before the Town and Fort of
<hi>Baſterre,</hi> the Enemy after firing two or three Rounds, had ſtruck their Flag, ſet their Town on Fire, and quitted it; (but by the Diligence of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who came on Shore from the Frigots, it was happily extinguiſhed:) Upon which advice, the Captain General marched immediately away to the ſaid Town, with intent to quarter the Army therein for that night; but the Enemy having left Store of Wines and other Liquors behind them, and he fearing the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it might breed amongſt the Souldiers, altered his Reſolutions, and only mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a halt there, and placing his own Company of Guards in the Maſs-houſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Army to march to the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> Convent, lying about a Mile above the Town, where being again drawn up, and Orders given to lie by their Arms all night, Centries were placed, and ſome Parties ſent to drive in Cattle, there being ſtore of Flower, Bread, &amp;c. in the Convent: The Night proved very wet, it rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Intermiſſion till Morning; but the Officers generouſly ſhared the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sentinels, ſcarce any, except the General Officers, going into the Convent for Shelter.</p>
            <p>The next morning (being Sunday the 22d) the Commiſſary General having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Liquors in a convenient Store-houſe, the Army marched down to the Town, and free liberty was granted them to plunder it; Wine and Brandy being alſo diſtributed to them, by the reſpective Commiſſaries of each Regiment; The Fort here conſiſted of Sixteen Guns, which they had nail'd and ſpik'd, but by the diligence of our Men, they were again cleared. In the Afternoon, a Detachment of one hundred and fifty Men out of the <hi>Antigua</hi> Regiment, was ſent under the Command of Major <hi>Gunthorpe,</hi> to gain and ſecure a Paſs, which was thought to be poſſeſſed by the Enemy, lying in the way to the Engliſh Fort; but when they came, the found it quitted. Monday (the 23d) we continued all Day in the Town; and in the Evening the Country was in flames all round, being Fired by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Negroes who came from the Mountains, where they had lain ſince their Maſters the Engliſh were beaten off the Iſland.</p>

            <p>On Fryday (the 27th) the <hi>Mary</hi>'s two Chaſe-Guns (Six Pounders) were brought on Shore, in order to be drawn up to the top of the Hill, and the <hi>Marine</hi> Regiment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105601:8"/>under the Command of Colonel <hi>Kirby,</hi> Commander of the Succeſs, (Collonel <hi>Keg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> being dead of his wound he received in landing) was imployed in cutting and clearing a patch, for the drawing them up. On Saturday and Sunday (the 28th and 29th) the
<hi>Marine</hi> Regiment ſo vigorouſly purſued their buſineſs, that they had drawn the Guns to the top of the Hill, and planted them upon a Platform they had laid for them, with Baskets of Earth thrown up for a Covering from the Enemies Shot, it lying open to the Fort: On Monday morning (the 30th) Powder Shot <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being carried up, they began to play upon the Fort, the very firſt Shot doing Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the Frigots alſo weighing from <hi>Old Road,</hi> ſtood down to the Fort and battered againſt it; the whole Army at the ſame time marching into a deep and wide Ditch, between the Hill and the Fort, within Musket Shot of it: In the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon the Frigots ſtood up again to <hi>Old Road,</hi> but the Guns from the Hill kept playing inceſſantly till Night, at which time we began our Intrenchments, running (from the Ditch where we lay encamped) a Trench, with a Half Moon at the End, capable of holding four hundred Men.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> one of the <hi>Nevis</hi> Regiments and part of the
<hi>Antigua</hi> Regiment, were ſent under the Command of Colonel <hi>Charles Pym,</hi> to take a ſmall Fort of the Enemies about three Miles diſtant from the Camp, which they ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſurprized, taking about fifty Priſoners in it.</p>
            <p>This Evening, Lieutenant General <hi>Holt</hi> having given Orders to the Out-Centries which were placed towards the Fort, to fire without Challenging at any who ſhould come that way; himſelf afterwards riding by them in the twilight to view the Works, was Shot into the Body by one <hi>Gibbins</hi> an Iriſhman, who was one of the Centries, he returned to the Camp and languiſhed long of it with little hopes of recovery: <hi>Gibbins</hi> was afterwards tried by a Court Marſhal, but after a full hearing acquitted.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday (the 2d) thoſe Guns on the Hill proving ſo ſerviceable, there were four more of a larger ſize drawn up; but one of them ſplitting at the firſt time of firing, and the reſt being incommodiouſly planted, they were no more made uſe of. This day four Companies of the Enemy marched out of the Fort, and drew up before the Gate, but in a quarter of an hour they marched in again. The Half Moon being now finiſhed, we run another Trench about a quarter of a Mile below it, able to contain the like number of Men; and at the like Diſtance below that we began another, wide enough to draw the Carriages of the great Guns through: the 3d, 4th, 5th, and
6th Days, we continued in the day time quiet in our Trenches, in the night running on with our works; the Enemy firing day and night upon us with great Guns and ſmall Arms, but doing us little damage, but the Guns on the Hill galled them exceedingly, leaving no Corner of the Fort unſearched.</p>
            <p>Some hundreds of the Enemy being out in the Mountains, headed by one Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Pinelle,</hi> Parties were ſent daily abroad (commanded by the Officers in their turns) to ſcour them out; and on Monday the 7th the Major General (his Wound being well healed) went himſelf at the head of two hundred Men, upon the ſame Deſign; but could not meet with the Enemy to engage them, they lurking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one place, ſometimes in another: On Wedneſday (the 9th) he returned to the Camp, with ſome Priſoners, many Negroes, and great Store of Cattle. After the Major Generals return, Proclamation being made, by beat of Drum, in ſeveral places of the Iſland, by the Command of the Captain General, that all which would come in within three Days, ſhould receive his Protection to ſecure their Perſons from the Outrages of the Souldiers; ſeveral Families ſurrendred themſelves, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which was alſo granted Liberty to return to their Houſes, and keep ſome ſmall ſtock till farther Orders.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Pinelle</hi> alſo ſent in a Flag of Truce from the Mountains, to acquaint the Captain General that he could not come in without leave from the Governour; but however he aſſured him, he would remain quiet, and give free paſſage to any of our Men he ſhould meet with: The 10th and 11th we continued in our Trenches, which we had now run within Piſtol Shot of the Fort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105601:8"/>Over againſt the Gate we had an half Moon, on which we planted ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: On the left hand of the Half-Moon was a Battery raiſed for ſix great Guns, (two eighteen Pounders and four twelve Pounders) but before they were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on Saturday the 12th, about one in the Afternoon, the Drums beat a Parly in the Fort, &amp; four Perſons marched out with a Flag of Truce; they were met in the Paſture between our Trench and the Fort, by Major
<hi>Legard,</hi> and by him conducted to the Captain General; and after ſome Treaty, Hoſtages were given on both ſides, one of the Majors continuing with us, and Lieutenant Colonel
<hi>Not</hi> was ſent to them; Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> alſo going with him as an Interpreter: But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treaty, the Captain General continued his workds, joyning our Trench to the Enemies Trench, through which they uſed to come from the Fort to the Well: Our Centries were placed under the Walls, and at the Gate of the Fort, and that Evening our Guns were alſo mounted upon the Battery.</p>
            <p>About twelve of the Clock in the Night there was a <hi>Canoe</hi> let over the Fort Walls, (it being ſituate by the Sea-ſide) which run on board a Sloop that came cloſe in with the Shore, under the Covert of the dark Night; our Men let Fly a whole Volly upon them, which made them haſten away. Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> came to the Centry at the Fort Gate, and Ordered him to acquaint the Major General, that there was a Ship ſeen off, upon which this Relator was diſpatched away to <hi>Old Road,</hi> to give Admiral <hi>Wright</hi> notice of it, but in the interim a <hi>Brigantine</hi> was ſent in purſuit of the Sloop; the Admiral immediately ordered two Frigots to weigh, and put out in ſearch of the ſaid Ship and Sloop, which they did, and the next Day the 13th they returned without ſeeing any Veſſels.</p>
            <p>During the whole Action upon this Iſland, there were two Frigots that cruiſed about, to take any French Veſſels which might arrive there, either by deſign or chance, but they met with none: On Monday the 14th, the Fort was ſurrendred to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General, upon the ſame Articles that it was before delivered up to the French. After the Enemy marched out, &amp; the Engliſh Flag was put up, the King's &amp; Queens Healths were drank, and the great Guns three times fired, three Vollies being alſo made by the whole Army. The Fort was Quadrangular, conſiſting of four Flankers, with a Curtain between each; on each Flanker were mounted five Guns; the Walls, were of Stone, about twenty Foot high, ſurrounded with a deep Ditch twelve Foot wide, over which was a narrow wooden Bridge. In the middle of the Fort were two Mounts thrown up for Batteries; there was alſo a Well, but upon firing the Guns, the Water would inſtantly dry away: There was Store of Proviſion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors and Powder, but they wanted Shot.</p>
            <p>In retaking this Iſland we had about an hundred Men killed and wounded; the Iſland in general is very Strong, there being ſeveral ſmall Fortifications, and Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works all round, except where it is naturally fortiſied with Hills or Shoals. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were about eighteen hundred Men, beſides Women and Children and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, all which (except the Negroes which were to be divided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as plunder) were transported to the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi> only ſome particular Perſons had the favour granted them to be carried up to <hi>Martineco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a Weeks Refreſhment, the Major General on Sunday the 20th of the ſaid Month of
<hi>July,</hi> Imbarqued with his own Regiment in the Sloops, and the <hi>Marine</hi> Regiment on board the Frigots, and ſet ſail for the Iſland of St. <hi>Euſtace;</hi> and the ſame Evening lying before the ſaid Iſland, he ſent Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> on Shoar with a Flag of Truce, to Summons the Iſland to ſurrender, who returned with an anſwer from the Governour, that he would defend it to the utmoſt; the next Morning (the 21ſt) the Frigots began to Batter againſt the Fort, and the Major General landed at the ſame time with his Men under a high Cliff, which they aſcended; being got up, they had not marched far, before they perceived ſome Dutch Colours in the Woods, upon which a Party was ſent to diſcover them, who returned with an Account, that it was Colonel <hi>Scorer</hi> (the Governour of the Iſland for the Dutch,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105601:9"/>when the French took it) with one hundred Men under his Command, who came from
<hi>Saba,</hi> and landed there three days before, but not having ſtrength enough to take the Fort, (into which the Inhabitants were fled) he deſigned to get what Plunder he could, and ſo go off again: He refuſed to joyn with the Major General, becauſe he was firſt landed, &amp; ſo accordingly went off the next day. The Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral proceeded in his march towards the Fort, and encamped within Musket Shot of it, under the riſing of a ſmall Hill; the next day the
<hi>Marine</hi> Regiment landed, and the Shovels, Pickaxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being brought on Shore, they began their Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, running their Trench along by the Fort, within Musket Shot of it.</p>
            <p>After five Days ſiege, the Enemy ſent out a Flag of Truce with Articles, but they were ſo high in their demands, that the Major General refuſed them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned an anſwer; if they did not deſcend to more reaſonable terms within three days, he would grant them no Quarter. Within the preſcribed time they came out again with a Flag of Truce, and ſurrendred themſelves and their Fort upon Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for life, &amp; to march out with their Baggage: Their Fort contained ſixteen great Guns, it was ſurrounded with double Rows of Stakes, the Intervals fill'd with Earth, and without that ſtrong Palliſadoes, and on the outſide of them a deep Ditch, over which was a very narrow Bridge leading into the Gate, admitting but one at a time; the Beſieged were about ſixty men, (the Women and Children being ſent off ſome time before) they had a Well for Water, and about twenty Barrels of Flower, ſome Salt-Fiſh and Pork, and a ſmall Quantity of Ammunition; they behaved themſelves very briskly during the ſiege, eſpecially the Governour, who was very active in firing the great Guns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In taking this Iſland, we had not above Eight Men kill'd and wounded: The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General leaving one Company upon the Iſland, under the Command of Lieutenant <hi>John Mack-Arthur,</hi> returned to St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> with the whole Fleet, carrying the Inhabitants Priſoners thither, and afterwards tranſporting them to <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<hi>Pilkinton</hi> was afterwards ſent down with a Company out of the Duke of <hi>Bolton</hi>'s Regiment, to relieve Lieutenant <hi>Mack-Arthur,</hi> and he ſtill continues there for the Defence of the ſaid Iſland.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Iſland of St. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> who were brought up Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from thence to <hi>Nevis,</hi> being ſent down to St <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> before that Iſland was retaken, there met with their Wives and Families; and after that Iſland was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, they were deſirous to live under an Engliſh Government, upon which the Captain General gave them Liberty, to return to their Iſland, tranſporting them thither, and granted a Commiſſion to one Captain <hi>le Grand</hi> a former Inhabitant among them, to be their Governour, and to keep and defend the Iſland in the name and behalf of their Majeſties King
<hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> under which Government it ſtill continues.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> this Relator's Concerns calling him home to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he left the <hi>Caribby Iſlands;</hi> the Captain General having then iſſued out Orders for the muſtering their Majeſties Forces, and getting them in a readineſs to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque upon a farther Expedition againſt <hi>Guadalupe</hi> and other French Iſlands, leaving a Garriſon upon St.
<hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have a brief and plain Relation of the Succeſs of the Engliſh Arms in the
<hi>Caribby Iſlands,</hi> and it may reaſonably be concluded, that as the Engliſh Affairs there have hitherto been happily proſperous, ſo (being under the management and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſuch prudent and active Generals, and promoted by the forwardneſs of the Souldiery, but principally by a Divine Bleſſing attending upon their Endeavours) they will ſoon put a ſucceſful Period to thoſe troubleſome Wars, and root the French Intereſts out of that part of the World.</p>
